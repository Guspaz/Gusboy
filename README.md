# Gusboy
C# Gameboy emulator

I created this emulator back in 2017, got it so most games I tried were playable, but stopped before implementing audio, because it seemed too hard. Now, years later, I've picked it up again, fully implemented audio (passes 8/12 dmg_sound), improved performance and accuracy (~1100 FPS on my machine in release mode if you bypass audio sync), cleaned up the code a bunch, etc. It's hardly "production quality" levels of accuracy or polish (very very far from it), but lots of games run without obvious major glitches.

It's still a work-in-progress, and I had no idea what I was doing at the start, so the design is a huge mess. I've started cleaning up and refactoring, but it's still not great. The CPU in particular, I cringe at how I implemented it as hundreds of standalone functions, so much code instead of even just relying on reference parameters. The thing is, the CPU execution unit, as hilariously bloated as it is, seems to work perfectly (passes cpu_instrs and instr_timing) and isn't a performance bottleneck, so it's not worth rewriting at the moment.

The UI depends on NAudio and WinForms, but the rest of the emulator should be fully platform-independent. All of the ways it interfaces with the appliation as a whole should be isolated. Video is handled via an int32 framebuffer and a callback function to tell the application the framebuffer can be rendered. Audio is handled by a float buffer that the application can consume as desired. Input is handled by KeyUp and KeyDown methods that the application can call. It's left up to the application to wire itself up to all that and call the emulator's tick function in a loop. Speed control is left up to the application too, the application in this case lets NAudio events run the emulator long enough to feed the audio buffer, so synced to audio. In the future I'll formalize these interfaces so that they're the only things exposed so that it's more obvious.

I'll fill in more details here later.
